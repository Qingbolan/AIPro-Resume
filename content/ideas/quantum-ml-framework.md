# Quantum Machine Learning Framework

A comprehensive framework that bridges quantum computing and machine learning to accelerate specific ML workloads using near-term quantum devices.

## Research Motivation

Current machine learning models face computational bottlenecks, especially in:
- High-dimensional optimization landscapes
- Feature mapping in complex datasets  
- Training large neural networks efficiently
- Solving NP-hard optimization problems

Quantum computing offers theoretical advantages for these problems through:
- Exponential speedup for certain algorithms
- Natural representation of high-dimensional spaces
- Quantum parallelism and superposition
- Novel optimization techniques (QAOA, VQE)

## Proposed Framework

### Core Components

1. **Quantum Feature Maps**
   - Efficient encoding of classical data into quantum states
   - Parameterized quantum circuits for feature transformation
   - Kernel methods with quantum advantage

2. **Hybrid Optimizers**
   - Classical-quantum parameter optimization
   - Gradient-based methods adapted for quantum circuits
   - Noise-aware optimization strategies

3. **Algorithm Library**
   - Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM)
   - Variational Quantum Classifiers (VQC)
   - Quantum Neural Networks (QNN)
   - Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

4. **Hardware Abstraction Layer**
   - Device-agnostic quantum circuit compilation
   - Error mitigation and noise characterization
   - Resource estimation and scheduling
