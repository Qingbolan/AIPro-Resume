        self.classical_network = DeepNeuralNetwork()
        self.hybrid_optimizer = HybridOptimizer()
    
    def forward(self, data):
        # Quantum feature encoding
        quantum_features = self.quantum_circuit.encode(data)
        
        # Classical processing
        classical_output = self.classical_network(quantum_features)
