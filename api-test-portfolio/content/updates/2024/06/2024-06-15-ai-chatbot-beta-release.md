```python
# Example of our context-aware response generation
class ContextAwareBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = ConversationMemory(max_turns=10)
        self.intent_classifier = BERTIntentClassifier()
        self.response_generator = GPTResponseGenerator()
    
    def generate_response(self, user_input, conversation_id):
        context = self.memory.get_context(conversation_id)
        intent = self.intent_classifier.predict(user_input, context)
        response = self.response_generator.generate(
            user_input, intent, context
        )
        self.memory.update(conversation_id, user_input, response)
        return response
```

#### Infrastructure Highlights
- **Microservices Architecture**: Scalable, maintainable design
